Your Smile Suite project is **significantly more advanced** than what's documented in your implementation file. The core online appointments functionality is **85% complete** and working well. The main focus should be on:

1. **Completing the patient appointment management features** (details view, cancellation, rescheduling)
2. **Enhancing clinic management capabilities** (settings, configuration, administration)
3. **Adding financial management features** (payments, invoicing, reporting)

The foundation is solid, and you're much closer to a production-ready system than the documentation suggests. Focus on the missing pieces rather than rebuilding what's already working well.

**Next Action:** Implement appointment details view and cancellation functionality for patients.
