# 🚨 CRITICAL: cPanel Deployment Structure Fix

## ❌ **The Problem**

Your domain `smilesuite.site` points to `public_html`, but your Laravel application is structured incorrectly. This is causing the 500 Internal Server Error.

## ✅ **The Solution**

You need to restructure your files in cPanel. Here's the correct structure:

### **Current Structure (WRONG):**

```
public_html/
├── .htaccess (your current file)
├── app/
├── bootstrap/
├── config/
├── database/
├── public/
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── build/
│   └── ...
├── resources/
├── routes/
├── storage/
├── vendor/
└── ...
```

### **Correct Structure (FIX THIS):**

```
public_html/
├── .htaccess (use the fixed version)
├── app/
├── bootstrap/
├── config/
├── database/
├── index.php (move from public/index.php)
├── build/ (move from public/build/)
├── images/ (move from public/images/)
├── psgc/ (move from public/psgc/)
├── robots.txt (move from public/robots.txt)
├── favicon.ico (move from public/favicon.ico)
├── resources/
├── routes/
├── storage/
├── vendor/
└── ...
```

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Update .htaccess**

1. Go to cPanel File Manager
2. Navigate to `public_html`
3. Delete the current `.htaccess` file
4. Create a new `.htaccess` file
5. Copy the content from `smilesuite-fixed.htaccess`
6. Save the file

### **Step 2: Move Files from public/ to public_html/**

1. **Move `public/index.php` to `public_html/index.php`**
2. **Move `public/build/` to `public_html/build/`**
3. **Move `public/images/` to `public_html/images/`**
4. **Move `public/psgc/` to `public_html/psgc/`**
5. **Move `public/robots.txt` to `public_html/robots.txt`**
6. **Move `public/favicon.ico` to `public_html/favicon.ico`**

### **Step 3: Update index.php**

After moving `index.php`, you need to update the paths inside it:

**Change this line in `public_html/index.php`:**

```php
// OLD (wrong paths)
require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
(require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php')

// NEW (correct paths)
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
(require_once __DIR__.'/bootstrap/app.php')
```

### **Step 4: Test Your Website**

1. Visit `https://smilesuite.site`
2. Check if the site loads correctly
3. Test navigation and assets

## 🚨 **Alternative Quick Fix (If Above Doesn't Work)**

If the above doesn't work, try this simpler approach:

### **Option A: Subdirectory Deployment**

1. Create a folder called `smile-suite` in `public_html`
2. Upload all your Laravel files to `public_html/smile-suite/`
3. Update your domain to point to `public_html/smile-suite/public/`
4. Use the original `.htaccess` from `public/.htaccess`

### **Option B: Document Root Change**

1. Contact Hostinger support
2. Ask them to change your document root from `public_html` to `public_html/public`
3. Keep your current file structure

## 🔍 **Why This Happened**

The issue is that:

1. Your domain points to `public_html` (the root)
2. But Laravel expects the `public` folder to be the document root
3. The `.htaccess` was trying to redirect to `public/index.php` but the paths were wrong

## ✅ **After Fixing**

Your website should work at:

-   `https://smilesuite.site` (main site)
-   `https://smilesuite.site/admin` (admin panel)
-   `https://smilesuite.site/patient/dashboard` (patient portal)

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check Error Logs:**

    - Go to cPanel → Error Logs
    - Look for specific error messages

2. **Check File Permissions:**

    - `public_html` folder: 755
    - `public_html/index.php`: 644
    - `public_html/.htaccess`: 644
    - `public_html/storage`: 755

3. **Contact Support:**
    - If still having issues, contact Hostinger support
    - They can help with server configuration

## 📋 **Quick Checklist**

-   [ ] Updated `.htaccess` with fixed version
-   [ ] Moved `public/index.php` to `public_html/index.php`
-   [ ] Moved `public/build/` to `public_html/build/`
-   [ ] Moved `public/images/` to `public_html/images/`
-   [ ] Moved `public/psgc/` to `public_html/psgc/`
-   [ ] Updated paths in `index.php`
-   [ ] Tested website at `https://smilesuite.site`

This should fix your 500 Internal Server Error! 🎉
